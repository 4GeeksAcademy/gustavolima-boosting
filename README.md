# Machine Learning Boosting Algorithms

This project was a learning process about Boosting Algorithms Hyperparameters in order to achieve better accuracy rates from the learning process. 
Based on a Decision Tree algorithm, various aproaches were taken to improve it.

Boosting is an important task to do following the initial build of the algorithm. It's not 100% guaranteed that you can increase the accuracy through boosting, but trying and experimenting with the hyperparameters is an essential task that can lead to better results. 
Also another way of boosting is to try a similar algorithm with the same end goal to see if perhaps we get better results. In this case I've started with a Decision Tree, and ended up using a Random Forest and also tried XGBoost to get all the juice out of the model and data. 

So all in all, Boosting is an important and mandatory process when working with ML algorithms.
